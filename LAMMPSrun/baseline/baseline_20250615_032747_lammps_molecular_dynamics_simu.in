Below is a LAMMPS input script that fulfills your requirements:

```lmp
# LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation using LJ units

# Specify units and dimension
units lj
dimension 3

# Initialize system
atom_style atomic
boundary f f f
lattice fcc 0.8442
region box block 0 10 0 10 0 10
create_box 1 box
create_atoms 1 box

# Set mass of atom type
mass 1 1.0

# Pair potential and neighbor settings
pair_style none
pair_modify shift yes

# Define SHAKE/RATTLE constraints
fix 1 all shake 0.0001 20 0 b 1 a 1

# Initialize velocities
velocity all create 1.0 87287

# Thermodynamic output
thermo 100

# Integration settings
timestep 0.005

# Run the simulation
run 25000
```

Please note that some specific parameters like the lattice constant or the temperature for velocity creation are set to arbitrary values, as they were not specified in your requirements. You may have to adjust these according to your specific simulation system.
