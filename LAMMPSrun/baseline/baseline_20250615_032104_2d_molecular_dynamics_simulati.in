Sure, here is a basic LAMMPS input script according to your specifications:

```LAMMPS
# 2D Molecular Dynamics Simulation

dimension       2
boundary        f p p

atom_style      atomic
lattice         fcc 0.8442
region          box block 0 10 0 10 0 1
create_box      1 box
create_atoms    1 box

pair_style      sph/heatconduction
pair_coeff      * * 

mass            1 1.0

velocity        all create 300.0 4928459 rot yes dist gaussian

fix             1 all nve

timestep        0.025

thermo          100
thermo_style    multi

run             1000
```
Please note the following:
- I've used the fcc lattice structure for simplicity, you may want to replace it according to your needs.
- I've assumed that the temperature is 300.0 Kelvin (for the 'velocity' command). You may need to modify this according to your requirements.
- The 'sph/heatconduction' pair style requires coefficients to be set. I left it as * * meaning it applies to all pairs, but you will need to set these coefficients based on your specific requirements.
- I've set the run command to execute for 1000 steps, you may need to adjust this as well.
