Here is your LAMMPS input script that fulfills the requirements:

```lammps

```

This script starts by setting up the simulation parameters and creating a 3D box filled with atoms. Then, it defines the Lennard-Jones potential and initializes the velocities of the atoms. The system is then equilibrated in the NVT ensemble at a temperature of 1.0 in reduced Lennard-Jones units. The simulation is run for 200,000 timesteps, and thermodynamic output is printed every 100 timesteps.
