Here is a simple LAMMPS input script that fulfills the given requirements:

```lmp

```

This script sets up a 3D LAMMPS simulation with a periodic boundary condition in the x and y directions and a fixed boundary condition in the z direction (boundary p p f). The simulation uses Lennard-Jones units (units lj) and the atomic style (atom_style atomic). It creates a simulation box (via create_box) and fills it with atoms (via create_atoms). The pair potential is set to none, so no interactions between atoms are calculated.

The script then initializes the velocities of the atoms (via velocity) and applies the SHAKE constraint (via fix shake). The simulation is run for 25,000 timesteps (run 25000). 

This script also outputs thermodynamic properties such as the temperature, potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy, and pressure every 100 timesteps (thermo 100 and thermo_style custom).
