# LAMMPS input script to simulate the hexagonal omega phase of titanium
# Using meam/sw/spline potential for atomic interactions

units metal
atom_style atomic
boundary p p p

# Define lattice parameters for hexagonal omega phase
# Lattice vectors are defined for a hexagonal structure
# The omega phase might have unique lattice constants 'a' and 'c'
variable a equal 4.60  # lattice constant a in Angstroms
variable c equal 2.95  # lattice constant c in Angstroms
