Fix styles 'ave/spatial' and 'ave/spatial/sphere' have been replaced
by the more general fix ave/chunk and compute chunk/atom commands.
All ave/spatial and ave/spatial/sphere functionality is available in these
new commands. These ave/spatial keywords & options are part of fix ave/chunk:
  Nevery, Nrepeat, Nfreq, input values, norm, ave, file, overwrite, title123
These ave/spatial keywords & options for binning are part of compute chunk/atom:
  dim, origin, delta, region, bound, discard, units

ERROR: This fix style is no longer available (../fix_deprecated.cpp:64)
Last command: fix 2 all ave/spatial 1 10 100 z lower 0.1 vz units reduced file vel.profile
