This script sets up a 2D simulation using LAMMPS, where large particles are treated as rigid bodies and interact with small SRD particles. Overlapping particles are removed to ensure a stable initial configuration, and SRD is used to simulate fluid-like interactions. The script includes periodic output of simulation properties.
