This script sets up a molecular dynamics simulation for a water system using the ReaxFF force field. It begins with an equilibration phase using the NPT ensemble to allow the system to relax, followed by a production phase using the NVE ensemble with a Langevin thermostat to ensure temperature stability. The oxygen atoms are restrained with a self-spring fix to hold their positions during the simulation.
