Note: This script assumes that the initial configuration, including the atom positions and necessary group definitions, are provided in the corresponding data files or have been set up previously in the simulation workflow. The `settings.lmp` file should contain the detailed definitions of styles, computes, groups, and fixes necessary for the simulation.
