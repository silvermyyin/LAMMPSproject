This script demonstrates how to replicate systems with and without periodic bond loops using the `replicate` command. It includes examples of simple linear chains, 2D grids, and a complex three-dimensional CNT system, each with appropriate visualization outputs. Ensure you have the necessary data files (`data.chain`, `data.grid2D`, `data.cnt3D`) and LAMMPS is configured with FFMPEG support for movie generation.
