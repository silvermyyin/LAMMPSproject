This script sets up a molecular dynamics simulation of silicon using a neural network-based potential, running under NPT conditions at 500 K. Ensure the file `silicon_nn.mtp` is available, as it contains the machine learning potential model parameters. Adjust the simulation box size or the number of timesteps as needed for your specific study.
