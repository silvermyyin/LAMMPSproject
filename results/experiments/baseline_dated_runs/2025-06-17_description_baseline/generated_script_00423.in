Note: This script assumes that the "settings.mod" file includes necessary styles, computes, groups, and fixes. Additionally, it assumes that the data file "data.system" defines atoms, bonds, and initial configurations. The potential ramp is managed via a variable "ramp" that changes linearly from `vmin` to `vmax` over the simulation. Adjust the atom types for the electrodes and ensure proper setup in the data file for a complete simulation.
