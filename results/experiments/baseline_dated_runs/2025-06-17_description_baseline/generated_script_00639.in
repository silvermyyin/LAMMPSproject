This script sets up a molecular dynamics simulation of a solvated deca-alanine peptide using the CHARMM force field in LAMMPS. It configures the system for use with the SHAKE algorithm, the PPPM method for long-range electrostatics, and the NPT ensemble with a drag coefficient for pressure control. The `fix imd` command is included for interactive molecular dynamics capabilities. Thermodynamic data is output every 100 timesteps, and a dump file is created every 1000 timesteps for analysis. Adjust the group definition based on the actual atom IDs in your `deca_alanine.data` file if needed.
