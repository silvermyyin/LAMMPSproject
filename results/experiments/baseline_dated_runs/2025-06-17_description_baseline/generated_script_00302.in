# LAMMPS Input Script for Elastic Constant Calculation
# This script calculates the elastic constants of a crystal structure
# using controlled deformations and measures the resulting stress changes.

# Include modular files
include init.mod
include potential.mod
include displace.mod

# Define variables for strain
variable strain equal 0.01

# Initialize simulation
units metal
dimension 3
boundary p p p
atom_style atomic

# Read the initial data
read_data data.crystal

# Apply the potential
include potential.mod

# Relax the box and the atoms
fix 1 all box/relax aniso 0.0
minimize 1.0e-10 1.0e-10 1000 10000

# Loop over the Voigt notation for elastic constants
# 1-6 correspond to xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy
label loop
variable i loop 6

# Apply positive strain
include displace.mod
variable sign equal 1
run 0

# Calculate positive stress
variable stress_pos equal -pxx  # Modify based on direction

# Apply negative strain
include displace.mod
variable sign equal -1
run 0

# Calculate negative stress
variable stress_neg equal -pxx  # Modify based on direction

# Compute elastic constants
variable C${i} equal (stress_pos - stress_neg) / (2*${strain})

# Output results
print "C${i} = ${C${i}} GPa"

jump SELF loop

# Calculate bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson ratio for cubic crystals
variable K equal (C11 + 2*C12)/3
variable G equal (C11 - C12 + 3*C44)/5
variable nu equal C12 / (C11 + C12)

print "Bulk modulus K = ${K} GPa"
print "Shear modulus G = ${G} GPa"
print "Poisson ratio nu = ${nu}"

Note: The `displace.mod` file should handle the displacements for both positive and negative strains, applying them in the direction specified by the Voigt notation `i`. The `potential.mod` file should define the interaction potential for the crystal structure, such as the Stillinger-Weber potential for silicon. The stress components (e.g., `pxx`, `pyy`, `pzz`) should be modified based on the current direction of interest.
