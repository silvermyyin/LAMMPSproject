This script sets up the simulation environment for modeling an electrochemical cell with gold electrodes and saline solution, using LAMMPS. It includes the use of `fix electrode/conp` to apply constant potentials to the electrodes and specifies the thermodynamic properties to be output during the simulation. The external file `settings.mod` is used to define additional styles, groups, computes, and fixes as required.
