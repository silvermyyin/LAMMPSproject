This script sets up a simulation for a graphene-ionic liquid supercapacitor. It assumes you have a `data.graphene_ionic_liquid` file for the atomic structure and a `settings.lmp` file for additional settings. The `fix electrode/conq` command is used to maintain constant charge on the electrodes, allowing charge transfer between them. The k-space solver is adapted for slab geometry, and thermodynamic output is configured to provide detailed insights every 50 steps.
