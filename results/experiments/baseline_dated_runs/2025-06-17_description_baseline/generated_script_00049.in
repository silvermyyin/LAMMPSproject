Note: This script assumes the existence of a custom pair style "potts/strain" appropriate for the Potts model with strain coupling. The `fix mc` command is employed for Monte Carlo moves, and the script runs for 100 sweeps in increments of 10. Ensure LAMMPS supports all specified commands and styles or modify them as per available features.
