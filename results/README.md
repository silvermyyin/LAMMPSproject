## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Viewing Recent Results
```bash

ls -la results/generated_inputs/pending_validation/

# View current baseline results (legacy)
ls -la results/baseline/

# Check simulation outputs (when implemented)
ls -la results/simulation_outputs/trajectories/
```

### Working with Legacy Results
```bash
# View existing baseline data
cat results/results_baseline.csv

# View baseline visualizations
open results/baseline_results.png
```

### Running Analysis (Planned)
```bash
# Analyze experiment results
python scripts/evaluation/performance_metrics/analyze_results.py \
  --input results/experiments/dated_runs/2024-01-15_rag_experiment/

# Compare different approaches
python scripts/evaluation/comparison/compare_experiments.py \
  --baseline results/benchmarks/baseline_comparison/ \
  --enhanced results/experiments/dated_runs/2024-01-15_rag_experiment/
```

### Generating Reports (Planned)
```bash
# Generate performance report
python scripts/evaluation/performance_metrics/generate_report.py \
  --input results/model_performance/ \
  --output docs/reports/performance_report.html
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Large File Sizes**: Use compression for trajectory files
2. **Missing Results**: Check experiment logs when implemented
3. **Legacy Data**: Use appropriate paths for legacy vs. enhanced structure

### Debug Information
- Legacy results in `baseline/` and `plots/` directories
- Enhanced structure directories are being populated
- Performance profiling data will be available in enhanced structure

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Legacy Data**: Current results are stored in `baseline/` and `plots/` directories. These contain valuable historical data and should be preserved during migration.

2. **Enhanced Structure**: The new organized structure (`generated_inputs/`, `simulation_outputs/`, etc.) is being implemented and will gradually replace the legacy organization.

3. **Migration Planning**: Legacy files (`baseline_results.png`, `results_baseline.csv`) should be integrated into the appropriate enhanced structure directories once they are fully implemented.
